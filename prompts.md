# AI Prompts to Kickstart Your Charity: Water Landing Page

## Basic Page Structure
Create a simple HTML layout for a nonprofit landing page with sections for a hero, a story, and a call-to-action.

## Style with Brand Identity
Write CSS using a color palette of [insert your brand colors] and fonts that feel [insert tone, e.g., bold and modern].

## Build the Hero Section
Create a hero section with a centered headline, subheadline, and full-width background image that grabs attention.

## Add Story + CTA Sections
Add a section for a real-world impact story with text and an image, and a donation section with a bold 'Donate Now' button.

## Make It Responsive
Add CSS media queries so this landing page looks good on both desktop and mobile devices. Add code comments to help explain why we use media queries.

Added simple example files:
- index.html — basic landing page (hero, story, donate).
- styles.css — beginner-friendly CSS with comments and a media query.

To open the page from the dev container's terminal, run:
